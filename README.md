# Exam 2
In this test, you will write an app with the same function for money management like the app in Mid term 1. However, you will use database and multiple activities.

All transactions (add or spend money) will be stored in a database. You need to create a table to store the transactions with date, category (reason), and amount. A positive amount is for adding money, a negative amount is for spending money.

Your app will have three activities: MainActivity, TransactionActivity and HistoryActivity. The MainAcitivity have with buttons to launch 1) the TransactionAcitivity to insert a transaction (add or spend an amount of money) into the database; and 2) the HistoryActivity to display all transactions.

The transaction is listed in a TableLayout and should be scrollable (i.e., put inside a ScrollView).
